# Walmart Sales Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project aims to gain insight into Walmart's sales data to understand the various factors influencing the sales performance of different branches. The comprehensive analysis covers aspects ranging from product lines to customer behavior, aiming to enhance business strategies and sales effectiveness.

## Project Aim
The major aim of this project is to delve into Walmart's sales data to discern the different elements that affect the sales of the various branches, with an emphasis on data-driven decision-making to refine sales approaches and customer engagement.

## Data Wrangling in Excel
The initial phase of the project involves meticulous data cleaning in Excel to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis:
- Identifying and addressing NULL and missing values.
- Feature engineering to enrich the dataset with new columns such as `time_of_day`, `day_name`, and `month_name`.

These additional attributes offer granular insights into sales patterns across different times of the day, days of the week, and months of the year.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with MySQL
Following the data cleaning process, EDA is conducted with MySQL to explore and answer the business questions listed below. This stage focuses on product analysis, sales trends, and customer segmentation.

### Business Questions
- General queries about the number of unique cities, city-wise branch distribution, and more.
- Product line analysis including the most selling product line and revenue by month.
- Sales trend analysis to gauge the effectiveness of different sales strategies.
- Customer behavior analysis to identify profitable customer segments and purchase trends.

## Analysis Results
The findings from the MySQL queries are presented, providing answers to key business questions that inform strategic decisions. The results offer insights into the most common payment methods, the most selling product lines, and the branches that outperform average sales.

## Conclusion
The analysis concludes with actionable insights that can help Walmart tailor its product offerings and sales strategies to the needs and preferences of its customers, ultimately driving sales and profitability.
